Face Recognition Attendance System
This project implements a simple face recognition attendance system using Python. It utilizes the face_recognition library to recognize faces and OpenCV (cv2) to capture images from the webcam. The recognized faces are then logged into a CSV file with the current date and time.

Prerequisites
Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
face_recognition library
OpenCV (cv2) library
numpy library
You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

pip install face_recognition opencv-python numpy
